        <h3>Bio Diversity</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>What is bio diversity ?</h4>
Biodiversity is the term used to describe  all the different kinds of species you’ll find in one area or collection of areas—the variety of animals, plants, and even microorganisms like bacteria  and their genetic variations plus the ecosystems patterns that make up any given natural environment.
There are three levels of bio diversity.these are ;

<h5>Genetic diversity : </h5><p>It refers to the diverseness in genes of organisms. Each individual of a specific species differs from each other in their genetic make up.  Which is the reason why you dont look  exactly like albus Dumbledore or your favourite aunt.
</p>
<h5>Species diversity:</h5> it refers to the difference between and within populations of species.
It ranges from vegetables to microorganisms and everything else that has life .
<p>
<h5>Ecosystem diversity:</h5> this is all the different biological communities , ecological processes and and variation within individual ecosystems. This ranges from diffrent types of ecosystems like oceans, rivers,rainforest,mountains and so on and also structures like food webs under which we find food chains which holds ecosystems together. 
</p>
<p>
These include diffrent  kinds of life, from the majestic blue whale to kids most hated vegetable . To make the  meaning clear let's consider broccoli which is a result of selective breeding. assuming its the kids most hated vegetable or  "most loved", we have different varieties of broccoli in this group which might seem small, 
like Romanesco,Waltham ,kai lan from China,  Calabrese and many more others. 
All these are different varieties of broccoli  are from the same group, but different ecosystems. 
There are some species that are not as lucky as broccoli and dont have close relatives (check out animals with no close relatives like you .they are cool)but  most species like broccoli have diverse families.for example
There are 35plus species of dolphins, 350,000 species of bettles plus which are  recorded 
You can easily see how we have an enormously huge number of species on our planet.and why it is still impossible to record every specie out there.
This is where the problem lies,  We are losing integral parts of our environment and we cant even tell who they are or what roles they play in the grand scheme of things.

<h5>Bio diversity loss.</h5>
<h6> What is biodiversity loss </h6>
 Biodiversity loss is the disappearance and decline in the  amount of genetic variability ,species variability and biological communities and biological processes variability.
