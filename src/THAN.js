              <p>Ordovician Period lasted about 45 million years, starting 488.3 million years ago and ending 443.7 million years ago. During this period, the area north of the tropics was almost entirely waters, 
Ordovician period constisted of diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). This marine society consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods. More recently, tetrahedral spores that are similar to those of primitive land plants have been found, suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time 

The extinction appears to have happened in phases
 (which is actually scary that we might be in one right now)see below.

 Scientists (paleontologists), however, acknowledge that glaciation over the African and South American portions of Gondwana(supercontinent) and the resulting fall in sea levels and changes to ocean current patterns were one of the main disruptions to climates and habitats. Massive drops in sea levels would have drained the shallow water bodies  and reduced the available habitat for organisms that thrived in those conditions 

This is what likely caused the mass extinctions that characterize the end of this era.
Most scientists (paleontologists) estimates that this extinction eliminated an estimated 85 percent of all the species that thrived in the Ordovician period..</p>

              The Devonian period occurred between 465 and 359 million years and it is mostly called "age of the fish" because of the  vast  diversity in  marine life that is seen during  this era.
This is the period when life really started taking hold on land, as the first true forests developed, along with amphibians and insects.
This mass extinction mostly affected marine societies which flourished in this period.
A lot of speculations have been brought up to what really brought about this catastrophe, but
Long periods of oceanic anoxia  — a lack of oxygen in the water , this caused  toxic waters in communities where these marine lives
  flourished seems to stand tall and this seems to have characterized the Late Devonian Mass Extinction as most paleontologists say .

this mass extinction consisted of of diffrent  events in a period estimated to be around 20 million years; these different events jointly caused a single massive loss of genetic diversity, almost 75% of the species that survived and thrived in this era went extinct.
.it was not a single event but  a combination of phases which were on and off that caused this extinction

              This is single most catastrophic event that has ever threatened life on our planet. Mostly referred to as the" Great Dying" 
The species that got wiped out in this massive extinction were various families of insects, plant species, amphibians,sharks,bony fish and alot of other types of life
Most scientists agree that it happened in a series of events through a period of 15 million years  However, some other scientists claim that the extinction interval was much more rapid, lasting only about 200,000 years,.
The cause of this extinction is a subject of debate with hypotheses ranging from 
Meteorite fall to eruptions . But most scientists (paleontologists) contend that Siberian traps eruptions brought about large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions that caused 
the extreme changes in the eco system at the time this is what's likely caused spike drops in oxygen levels, elevated global temperatures, and in the water communities it led to widespread anoxia and lots of acids in the habitats of marine life. But it's still a topic of discussion and debate what really made the habitats of these species uninhabitable.

Happened around: 
It is estimated that  90% – 96%Percent of species that thrived in this period went extinct

             This extinction event occurred at the end of the Triassic Period 
               that caused end of a lot of species,
             both marine and terrestrial species suffered this  deadly fate . this event was not as bad as the  last one 
             but still caused many species to die out .
             The cause of this extinction is a subject of debate. Many scientists contend that this event was caused by climate change and rising sea levels resulting from the abrupt emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide. 
             there are  lot of scientists who also argue that this event was not a result of one mass continuing cause. but 
             a prolonged turnover of species across a considerable amount of time and thus should not be called as a mass extinction event.
             it is estimated that 76 percent of all marine and terrestrial species and about 20 percent of all taxonomic families.

              <p> This is the one that most people visualise the one that took down  non-avian dinosaurs 
                      It also destroyed alot of terrestrial organisms 
                      Like some mammals, lizards, insects and birds and it also caused mayhem in the waters that led to alot of changes in the  ecosystem that led to extinction of several marine life species like Plesiosaur and some types of  sharks, mollusks and others .the only group of dinosaurs that survived are the avian type which are still among us today as "birds" , also there was a mass extinction of plants that was caused by a rapid change of conditions that they had lived under for millions of years. 
                      turtles, crocodilians, lizards, and snakes were not affected that much. amphibians and mammals weren't also severely injured 
                      most of the animals  and plants types that lived deep under the sea survived and most of them  are represented by species among us today
                      .the most widely accepted hypothesis about cause of this mass extinction is that a massive asteroid  hit our planet And caused this extinction by ejecting rock debris into earth's atmosphere which made it hard for the sun to get to through and without sunlight photosynthesis can't happen ,this leads to death of green plants and in return to animals that feed on them and this way the food chain was disrupted .
                      This is the most obvious of all the mass extinctions because it happened abruptly and caused extinction to its victims quickly but not the most severe. it ranks third in severity . It brings a feeling that some time everything we have been and known will cease to exist on account to something we cannot control. 
                      it is a good example about  limitations of man but not good when we are looking for ways we can go forward and live to see another day ,and push our limitations  even more like our ancestors have done.And speaking of ancestors we would need to take with us all these other guys that have passed through a really narrow path to make it here today. Which sounds right to me considering we share the same ancestorial background. Which is " life itself "
                      And I think that the best way today is to  get examples from other extinctions which happened because of things we are doing right now and can control.</p>
