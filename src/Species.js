    Title: "Tiger",
    About:'William Blake’s “forests of the night,” the stalking grounds of the six subspecies of tiger, are burning bright. Slash-and-burn agriculture, along with logging, and human encroachment, have hugely diminished the habitat available to these felines, which require extensive ranges capable of supporting the large herbivores that constitute the bulk of their diets. Poaching—for trophies and body parts used in Asian “medicine” —is thought to pose the greatest threat to tigers. Probably fewer than 4,000 are left in the wild. In 2014, China explicitly outlawed the consumption of endangered species, including tigers, whose bones, penises, and other organs are superstitiously believed to have magical curative powers.'

    Title: 'Giant Panda',
    About: 'They’re known as “charismatic megafauna” for a reason. These endangered animals ooze star power, a factor that conservationists have capitalized on in order to fund projects to protect them (and, often by default, the other organisms that share their complex ecosystems). People are far more likely to donate money to save an adorable panda or a magnificent tiger than they are to drop some shekels on preserving the limbless worm skink or the Gerlach’s cockroach. However, skinks and roaches are integral participants in their ecosystems as well and just as deserving of assistance as their flashier compatriots. You might then consider the animals on this list the A-listers whose box office draw finances the continued existence of the lesser-known character actors who inhabit the same environments. And if the concept of trickle-down conservation sticks in your craw, get to work on that “save the Gerlach’s cockroach” Kickstarter campaign. I’d donate. Maybe.'

    Title: "BLUE WHALE",
    About: "There are fewer than 25,000 blue whales, the largest animals on the planet. Comprising several subspecies, blue whales are found in all of the world’s oceans save the Arctic. The current population is thought to have been reduced by up to 90% by whaling in the 20th century. Commercial hunting of the species was ultimately banned in 1966. The National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. spelled out a recovery plan in 1998. It stipulated the maintenance of photo databases of individual specimens and the collection of genetic and migration data in order to better understand the species, which remains at risk from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing nets."

    Title: ' snow leopard',
    About: "Though it’s called a leopard—and certainly resembles a frosted version of those spotted habitués of more equatorial regions—the snow leopard is actually more closely related to the tiger, at least per genetic analysis. Probably fewer than 6,500 remain in the wild, though due to the remote mountainous terrain preferred by the species, and its elusive nature, data is hard to come by. The largest populations are in China and Mongolia, with significant populations in India and Kyrgyzstan as well. Its natural prey include blue sheep and ibex, but in some areas, it is heavily dependent on domestic animals. The farmers who depend upon the animals shoot the “problem” leopards. Poaching still constitutes a major threat to the species, as does overhunting of its natural prey species."

    Title: "gorilla ",
    About: 'Depending on who you ask, there are either two species of gorilla, the eastern (Gorilla beringei) and western (Gorilla gorilla), or three subspecies, the eastern lowland, western lowland, and mountain gorillas. Regardless of who you ask, all gorillas are endangered. There are probably only around 220,000 left in the wild. Habitat encroachment and poaching for bushmeat, trophies, and magical talismans have led to substantial losses. Because their social structure is so complex and because they reproduce slowly—with females only giving birth once every four years at best—the removal of even a few individuals from a gorilla troop can catastrophically impact its ability to sustain itself.',

Title: 'orangutan',
About: 'Orangutan” is Malaysian for “person of the forest.” Though morphologically they may resemble melted Muppets more than people, their sophisticated cognitive abilities are very human indeed. Like gorillas and chimpanzees, they have been known to use tools. Due in large part to logging and capture for the exotic pet trade, orangutans—restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra—number fewer than 60,000 per a 2004 study. Unlike other great apes, they are usually solitary or live in groups of fewer than three, making them difficult to track and study.',

    Title: "Tasmanian devil ",
    About: 'Between 1996 and 2008, the population of Tasmanian devils dropped some 60% due a contagious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease. It continues to decimate populations of the species, which only occurs on the Australian island of Tasmania. There may only be 10,000 wild individuals remaining. Captive breeding of uninfected individuals has been instituted and efforts have been made to develop a vaccine for the cancer, which is thought to have stemmed from mutated cells from a single specimen.',

    Title: "ASIAN ELEPHANT",
    About: 'The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia. It lives in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India and Nepal in the west to Borneo in the south. Asian elephants are very sociable and form groups of six to seven related females that are led by the oldest female, the matriarch. The species has been listed as Endangered since 1986. It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat and poaching.',

    Title: "AFRICAN PENGUIN ",
    About: 'The African penguin is a species of penguin living in southern African waters and is the only penguin species of Africa. They can swim with a speed of 20 km/h and can dive up to 130 m deep. The species has been in decline since the beginning of the industrial age because of overfishing, habitat destruction, coastal development and a number of other human influences.',

    Title: "POLAR BEAR",
    About: 'The polar bear is a large bear classified as a marine mammal because it spends most of its live on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean. Polar bears have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellant coat that insulates them from the cold air and water. Their numbers are in decline because of ongoing loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change, and they are listed as a Vulnerable species.',

    Title: "SEA TURTLE ",
    About: 'Sea turtles are large air-breathing reptiles and are one of the Earth,s most ancient creatures. They play a vital role in the balance of marine habitats. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. They suffer from poaching, over-exploitation and habitat destruction. It is hard to estimate their population as they are very difficult to track',
