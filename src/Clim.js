        <h5> what is climate change?</h5>
        <p>Climate change is the long term shifts in the earths temperature and weather patterns</p>
    <p>For the most part of earths existence these shifts have been natural but since 1800s man's activity
    has been the major cause of these temperature shifts mainly because of industrialization that started during this
    period and still goes on till this day.
<h5>How does industrialization affect Climate change </h5>
<p>
since the industrial revolution humans activities like the burning fossil fuels, including coal and oil,
 have increased greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere which causes global warming this this leads to a lot
 of catastrophic events for humans and every other species on this planet
 <p>The increased heat affects  our weather patterns in a way that changes it causing loads of problems to species that benefit from the consistent patterns in which 
    they have thrived in for so long </p>. 
    <p>And also too much heat that is refracted back to earth by the green house gases in the atmosphere causes glaciers
        to melt which increases sea levels which could possibly cause catastrophic floods
    </p>
    Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is being absorbed by our oceans, making them more acidic , this 
        degrades the  health of the aquatic ecosystems which could possibly lead to extinctions of a lot of marine 
        species
